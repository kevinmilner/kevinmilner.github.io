Kevin works for the [Southern California Earthquake Center](https://www.scec.org) at the University of Southern California, where he earned PhD in Geological Sciences (emphasis in Geophysics). His primary research interest is probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). He is the lead developer of [OpenSHA](http://www.opensha.org), an open-source PSHA platform, and of the [Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities](http://www.wgcep.org). The latter develops state-of-the-art earthquake forecasts for California (e.g. the [third Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast](https://www.scec.org/ucerf)) which are used as input to the building code, earthquake insurance rates, and the USGS National Seismic Hazard Maps.
