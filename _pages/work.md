Kevin works for the [Southern California Earthquake Center](https://www.scec.org) at the University of Southern California, where he is also a PhD Candidate. His primary research interest is probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). He is the lead developer of [OpenSHA](http://www.opensha.org), an open-source PSHA platform, and of the [Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities](http://www.wgcep.org). The latter develops state-of-the-art earthquake forecasts for California (e.g. the [third Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast](https://www.scec.org/ucerf)) which are used as input to the building code, earthquake insurance rates, and the USGS National Seismic Hazard Maps.
