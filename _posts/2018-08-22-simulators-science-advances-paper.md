Bruce Shaw, myself, and the rest of the Collaboratory for Interseismic Simulation and Modeling (CISM) just published a new paper in Science Advances, which demonstrates how physics-based earthquake simulators can replicate hazard statistics of traditional empirical models. Check out the article [here](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/8/eaau0688.abstract), or read an article about it [here](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/news-events/milestone-forecasting-earthquake-hazards). The video below shows an animation of 3,000 years of ruptures from the simulated earthquake catalog.
