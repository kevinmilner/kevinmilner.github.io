My good friend [Sean Pawling](https://seanpawling.com) just realeased a new album, [Sunsinking](https://seanpawling.com/album/sunsinking). I had the pleasure of laying down some steel on track 11, [*Wait for the Silence*](https://seanpawling.com/track/wait-for-the-silence). Give it a listen on YouTube below, or support Sean by buying the album from his [Website](https://seanpawling.com). Steel comes in at about the 2:25 mark, with a big outro solo. As a bonus, much of the vocals and some other elements were recorded in my studio, Precarious Rock Studios.
