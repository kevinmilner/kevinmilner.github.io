My friend Chris Rasmussen's band Laureline just realeased a new album, [Wash](https://open.spotify.com/album/0skkQvJrUcjl6g2COQOkM5). He asked me to play steel on track 12, "Ladies' Man," which you can [listen to on Spotify here](https://open.spotify.com/track/1VqD55OiHze5dP9rggktsf)! It's outside of my usual wheelhouse, kinda spacey indie pop, but a cool sound so give it a listen! They also pitched down some of my takes and put it on another track, "Holding You, Holding Me," though it's a little harder to pick out.
